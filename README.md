# PymiRa - A rapid and accurate classification tool for small non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs

- Use pymira_v1.py
- Best to use in IDE - cmd version in progress
- Default behaviour - main function - mismatch_5p = 0 mismatch_3p = 2.
- Attempts 0 mismatches for entire read. If mismatch then will retry allowing 'mismatch_5p' mismatches at 5' and 'mismatch_3p' at 3'.

`main(fasta_path, reference_path, out_path)`
